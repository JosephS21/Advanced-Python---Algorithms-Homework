# Exercises
# Exercise #1
# Reverse the list below in-place using an in-place algorithm.
# For extra credit: Reverse the strings at the same time.

# Exercise #2
# Create a function that counts how many distinct words are in the string below, then outputs a dictionary with the words as the key and the value as the amount of times that word appears in the string.
# Should output:
# {'a': 5,
# 'abstract': 1,
# 'an': 3,
# 'array': 2, ... etc...

# Exercise #3
# Write a program to implement a Linear Search Algorithm. Also in a comment, write the Time Complexity of the following algorithm.

# Hint: Linear Searching will require searching a list for a given number.Â¶
